How to access the RDS from ec2 instances - IAM DB Authentication
AWS Budgets - set custom budgets 
Cost Explorer - visualize and manage your cost
If you are not able to connect to instance -> pem converted and user name is correct or not 
Frequent schema changes - dynamo db
Metrics that is not available in Cloudwatch metrics - memory
Lambda sensitive information keep in KMS
Kinesis firehose -> s3, redshift, elastic search and splunk
move the application from on prem to aws and use the same IP Address -> create Route Origin Authoriation(ROA) and then advertise your whitelisted ip
Improve the writethroughput of database -> RAID 0 with 2 EBS volumes, increase instance size
Idenitty federation - ad directory service AD connector and RBAC -> IAM Role
How to monitor your database - enable enhanceed monitoring in rds
s3 singlesign on -> setup federation proxy or identity provider , configure IAM role and policy 
5 messages recieved 20 times -> message delete is not happening 
Redshift define the number of query queues how queries are routed for processing -> Use workload management(WLM) in the parameter group configuration.
Redshift - montiroing all copy and unload -> enhance vpc routing
ECS secure credentials -> in system management store 
Default montiriong - console and enhanced monitoring - CLI
montirong disck utilization and moemry -> install cloud watch agenet which gathers disk utlizaiton and memory and view custom etrics
how you will ensure high avialablity and fault tolerance without elb - scripts, assign ip address 
Signed url -> RTMP distribution, restrict access to invidial files,
signed cookies -> no rtmp, access to multiple files, no change in current url.
Root volume can be used when instance is running while taking snapshot
which instance will be out -> Asg having oldest configuration
Aurora write capacity to high priority one and read capacity to low priority one -> create custom endpoints
improve dynamo db performance -> partition key with low cardinality attributes have few dinstinct values
shield - ddos 
less usage -> cold HDD
Traffic shiftings
